# Terminal blackjack

'''
This is a simple game of blackjack that plays in the command-line terminal.
There are still a few aspects that need to be decided:
- Will more than one player be able to play against the dealer/computer?
- Will the deck be shuffled/randomized and prior to a hand, or will the only one card be determined at a time? (Schrodinger's deck)
- How many hands can be used with one deck?
- Will a manual be provided?
- How will scoring be determined? (a point per hand won vs betting)
