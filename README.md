# Terminal Blackjack  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64247887/128559437-b253b51e-8170-4df9-a3f2-f9c4615f8c35.png)

This is a simple blackjack game that is played in the terminal window. I am making this game to practice using GitHub to plan, organize, and maintain a development project, and most importantly, for FUN.

## How to Play
In the game of Blackjack, the player plays against the dealer. In Terminal Blackjack, the computer is the dealer. The objective of the game is to get as close to a score of 21 as possible without going over. A player's score is determined by adding up the total value of his or her hand. Each numbered card is worth face value. Face cards are each worth 10 points. Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points depending on the rest of the card values in the player's hand.

The current version of this game is a much simplified adaptation of Blackjack in which there is one round per game. After the game greeting, the player chooses to either "hit" or "stay" after being dealt cards. For an additional card, the player must choose `H` or `h` for a **Hit**. To lock in their current hand, the player must **Stay** by typing an `S` or `s`.
  
After the player's turn is over by either choosing to stay or by busting (going over 21 points), the dealer will deal their hand. The dealer must choose to hit if their hand's value is less than 16. After the dealer stays or busts, the winner is determined.
