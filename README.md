# Terminal Blackjack

This is a simple blackjack game that is played in the terminal window. I am making this game to practice using GitHub to plan, organize, and maintain a development project, and most importantly, for FUN.

## How to Play
In the game of Blackjack, the player plays against the dealer. In Terminal Blackjack, the computer is the dealer. The objective of the game is to get as close to a score of 21 as possible without going over. A player's score is determined by adding up the total value of his or her hand. Each numbered card is worth face value. Face cards are each worth 10 points. Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points depending on how the player chooses.
